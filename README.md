# qr-menu-generator

create a website with below scenarios
1. This website should have 2 options 'Create QR Code with Existing Menu Images', if this is clicked then user should be shown a page to upload multiple images. Once images are uploaded there should be a button to generate the QR Code.
2. The second option is to allow users to create a new menu, where in they can add the product name and its price, and once they save it should show the Menu with all the published details
3. In both scenarios, once they publish their website, a qr code would be generated.
4. Scanning this qr code will redirect them to a website page of their newly published menu.
